# VIF Test for multicollinearity of independence variables
def vif_test(
    x: np.ndarray
) -> list:

    """
    Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for multicollinearity.

    Description:
        In modelling development, multicollinearity is a phenomenon in which two or more predictor variables
        in a multiple regression model are highly correlated, meaning that one can be linearly predicted
        from the others with a substantial degree of accuracy.
        
        The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) computation is used to depict the existence of multicollinearity
        (correlation between independence variables) in a regression analysis. The VIF quantifies how much
        the variance of the estimated regression coefficients are inflated as compared to when the predictor
        variables are not linearly related.

    Args:
        x (np.ndarray): Input data of independence variables MEV(s) in the model.

    Returns:
        List: List of VIF on each independence variables MEV(s) in the model.

    Notes:
        - If the VIF is less than (<) 5, the model is passed multicollinearity assumption.
        - If the VIF is greater than or equal to (>=) 5, the model is not passed multicollinearity assumption.

    """
    Anderson-Darling Test for residual normality.

    Description:
        The Anderson-Darling test tests the null hypothesis that a sample is 
        drawn from a population that follows a particular distribution, which is
        a normal distribution in this case. The output from Scipy library returns
        the Anderson-Darling test statistic not p-value when method is None.
        
        To derive the p-value follows the SAS Calculation logit, the paper of
        R.B. D'Augostino and M.A. Stephens, Eds., 1986, Goodness-of-Fit Techniques, Marcel Dekker is leveraged.

    Args:
        residual (pd.Series): Model residual from statsmodels.

    Returns:
        Float: p-value follows SAS Calculation logic.

    Notes:
        - If the p-value is greater than (>) 0.05, the residual is followed normal distribution.
        - If the p-value is less than or equal to (<=) 0.05, the model is not passed normality assumption.

# ADF Test for residual stationary (Co-integrated)
def adf_test(
    residual: pd.Series
) -> float:
    
    """
    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test for residual stationary.

    Description:
        The time series model is generally required staionary variables in the model.
        However, it might limit the comprehensive combination if selecting only stationary variables.

        The Engle-Granger Cointegration methodology is leveraged two-stages regression as following.
        First, assuming all independence variables are unit-root (non-stationary).
        Second, using the linear combination of independence variables run regression.
        Third, ADF testing on model residuals instead of each independence variables.
        If the residuals are stationary, the independence variables are cointegrated.

    Args:
        residual (pd.Series): Model residual from statsmodels.

    Returns:
        Float: p-value.

    Notes:
        - If the p-value is less than or equal to (<=) 0.1, the residual is stationary.
        - If the p-value is greater than (>) 0.1, the model is not passed normality assumption.
        - The limitation of Engle-Granger Cointegration methodology:
            - The cointegration result is appropriate for two variables. For multiple variables, the Johansen cointegration test is better.
            - The method assumes a linear cointegrating relationship, which may not hold in all cases.
            - The results can be sensitive to the choice of the dependent variable in the cointegrating regression.
